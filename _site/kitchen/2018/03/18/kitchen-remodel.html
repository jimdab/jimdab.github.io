    <p>We decided to remodel our kitchen. Mind you, our kitchen looks fine the way it is…</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1115.jpg" alt="Kitchen 1" /></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1113.jpg" alt="Kitchen 2" /></p>

<p>but there are some problems. Mostly they stem from the fact that all the cabinet doors are falling off. You see, the previous owners seem to have had all the doors removed, stripped and restained to the color you see here. While that worked fine, one problem we’re finding is that the side walls of the cabinets are that cheap particle board and when you remove screws from it and then try to re-screw the hinges back into the same place, they just don’t stay. So we end up with a number of them looking like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1172.jpg" alt="Hinge falling off" /></p>

<p>To make matters worse in one place, they wanted a big cabinet, so they just cut out the center partition that holds things up and we now have this happening.</p>

<p>So we want a change.</p>

<hr />

<p>Having watched plenty of <a href="https://www.hgtv.com">HGTV</a> over the years, we knew we wanted a design-build company to come in and help us decide on how it should look and then actually do the work and subcontracting.</p>

<p>We first found a local company who seemed interested, but after getting some preliminary renderings from them they went dark. No responses to our “We like this. We want to hire you. Please contact us.” emails so we gave up on them.</p>

<p>Then we went to <a href="http://www.propertyrevival.net">Property Revival</a>. They’ve been pretty good so far. We started with them almost a year ago. We’ve spent that time going over every little detail about what we want. Most of that time is Dena and I changing our minds on countertops, cabinets, faucets, sinks, etc. But we’re finally done picking things out and should be ready to start soon.</p>

<p>Here is how the kitchen is laid out now.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1169.jpg" alt="Original kitchen layout" /></p>

<p>We’re going to remove the peninsula and replace it with a big island. We’re also going to remove the wall between the kitchen and the family room to go with a more open concept.</p>

<p>Soon we should be signing the contract and having our final walk though and then getting on the calendar. I plan to keep blogging our progress as we go. So stay tuned. More to come (and soon I hope).</p>
