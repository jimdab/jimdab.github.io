    <p>Almost ready to start!</p>

<p>So we had our “final walkthrough” a couple of weeks ago, which really wasn’t final, cause we’re gonna have yet another “final walkthrough” just before they actually start – which is Tuesday, May 1. They wanted to start Monday, April 30 but Dena and I will be travelling back from Idyllwild, CA and we didn’t want them to start when no one was here. We figure someone should be here to let them in.</p>

<p>So, what have we been doing in the meanwhile? Cleaning out the kitchen! We have to get everything moved out so they can start demoing.</p>

<p>First we had to get everything out and our kitchen looked a bit like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1192.jpg" alt="Cleaning the kitchen" /></p>

<p>Then today, Greta, Tom &amp; Traigh came by to take our appliances. Turns out, they’re remodeling <em>their</em> kitchen as well and our appliances would go just fine in their new kitchen. So what the heck. They also took some of our countertop since they’re building a peninsula as well. Who knew you can just saw through a countertop with a circular saw? So our kitchen looks a bit different now.</p>

<p>The smart reader out there is asking, “What are you doing for eating?” Well, we moved into the basement!</p>

<p><img src="http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1210.jpg" alt="Very cozy" /></p>

<p>We have this beautiful bar with a mini-fridge and a nice room behind it so we decked it out and we’re basically gonna live down here for the two months while our kitchen is being redone. It’s a bit cozy, but it’ll work.</p>

<p>That’s it for now. The next step is we meet with them this Thursday for our final-final-walkthrough and then they begin the following Tuesday. Once that happens, I plan to blog every day showing the progress and adding some pithy commentary (I hope). Keep coming back, should be fun!</p>
