    <p>Welcome to my blog reboot.</p>

<p>This blog has completely languished for a long time. No, I haven’t been working on my boat either, hopefully that comes next. No, I’ve been experiencing paralysis by analysis.</p>

<p>I wasn’t really happy with MoveableType as the engine of my blog. Call me stupid but I just couldn’t get the hang of tweaking the templates and the CSS to get things to look the way I wanted. So, I decided to move to something else, but what?</p>

<p>There began my long, lonely search for a new thing to generate my blog. I knew I wanted a static blog and I wanted one that had would generate some clean, neat HTML and CSS that I could understand and tweak as I desired. I looked at a bunch: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, <a href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a>, <a href="https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus">Cactus</a> and many more that I can no longer recall. (I actually kinda wish I had kept track and kept notes, it would have made a great meta-review of static blog posting enginges.) In the end I chose <a href="http://wintersmith.io">wintersmith</a>. What you see is the result of this search (update a year later: no it’s not. I just switched again, this time to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jeckyl</a>).</p>

<p>I like wintersmith. There are some things I don’t like about the organization of the files. I would prefer it if I could have all my files organized in a hierarchical directory system organized by year, month and day (the articles currently all just reside in one big directory) and I don’t fully get the templating system enough quite yet to tweak it completely to my liking. But, I can live with the directory structure, I probably won’t be posting more than one time per day anyway and I can learn the template system over time.</p>

<p>So now hopefully I will start to actually write here on a regular basis. Next step is to get back to work on my boat. I’m embarassed at how long it’s been since I’ve worked on it.</p>
