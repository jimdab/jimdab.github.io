        <title>Kitchen Remodel Day 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;And the walls come tumbling down—well, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1272.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day 3 kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue to make slow but steady progress I guess. That whole wall, for the most part, is coming down and will then be open to the family room. Looks like they’ll need to move some plumbing I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the foyer they got that top layer of tile off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1271.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Day 3 foyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should just leave it? Kinda trendy and plaid-looking with the old tile and the left-over grout. OK, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Day 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked. I honestly think never before in the history of home remodeling projects has a project been reduced in scope and price. But yet, that is exactly what happened to me today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally approach this project with the thought that if the project lead ever calls me in the middle of the day, it’s gonna be bad news. Why else would they need to call, right? So today I get a call from Jerry and I’m thinking, “oh shit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;phone rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim: Hello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jerry: Hi Jim, this is Jerry, how you doing today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim: Fine ’til you called. (Yes, I really said that, I know, I’m a jerk.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he goes on to tell me that he actually had good news. Remember that tile over tile over concrete thing in the foyer? Well, turns out, he decided if he removed it all the way down, he would have to rebuild up the subfloor by 2–3” which seemed silly to him. So he had the bright idea to only remove the top layer of tile and then tile right back over the old layer. This means no jackhammering, no rebuilding up the subfloor which saves both time and money from the original quote! Yay me! So, all he has to do is fix up that area they already dug into and they’re good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will wonders never cease? Let’s hope so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the kitchen, they basically got all the tile off. That was about it for the day. I’ll leave you with one glorious picture of a plywood floor and talk to you later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Day 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here it is! Day 1! The start of our kitchen remodel. I hope to post every day about how the changes went so &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; can share with me the joys of a full kitchen remodel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before: 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1129.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1124.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1131.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after: 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1262.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;After 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1263.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;After 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1264.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;After 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I must say, this is going to be interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1266.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Foyer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They mentioned there being concrete below the tile in the foyer but they didn’t quite notice the layer of tile &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; the current tile, and then concrete below that. No word yet on if this’ll cost us extra. They were already anticipating having to jack-hammer all the concrete out—maybe that extra layer of tile won’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for day 1. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Part V</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost ready to start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we had our “final walkthrough” a couple of weeks ago, which really wasn’t final, cause we’re gonna have yet another “final walkthrough” just before they actually start – which is Tuesday, May 1. They wanted to start Monday, April 30 but Dena and I will be travelling back from Idyllwild, CA and we didn’t want them to start when no one was here. We figure someone should be here to let them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what have we been doing in the meanwhile? Cleaning out the kitchen! We have to get everything moved out so they can start demoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we had to get everything out and our kitchen looked a bit like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1192.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cleaning the kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then today, Greta, Tom &amp;amp; Traigh came by to take our appliances. Turns out, they’re remodeling &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; kitchen as well and our appliances would go just fine in their new kitchen. So what the heck. They also took some of our countertop since they’re building a peninsula as well. Who knew you can just saw through a countertop with a circular saw? So our kitchen looks a bit different now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1213.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Empty kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1212.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;More empty kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The smart reader out there is asking, “What are you doing for eating?” Well, we moved into the basement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1209.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basement&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1210.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Very cozy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have this beautiful bar with a mini-fridge and a nice room behind it so we decked it out and we’re basically gonna live down here for the two months while our kitchen is being redone. It’s a bit cozy, but it’ll work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now. The next step is we meet with them this Thursday for our final-final-walkthrough and then they begin the following Tuesday. Once that happens, I plan to blog every day showing the progress and adding some pithy commentary (I hope). Keep coming back, should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Part IV</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Eh. Had our “final walk-through” with the builders. The lead guy came here with the lead builder-guy who will be doing most of the work. They pretty much agreed that, yep, work needed to be done. About the only new thing that came out of this meeting was our start date: May 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So hopefully we’ll have our new kitchen in place by July 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. See ya next time!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Part II</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we met with our project manager, Jerry, for our kitchen remodel. We went over the final estimates and the contract. He gave us a nice overview of how the process will work and what they’ll do. He says to be ready for some stressful times. I think we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of the new floor plan I talked about in the previous post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1175.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Revised floor plan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignore the way the seating is drawn in there — otherwise its all correct. One big island, fridge built into the wall where we currently have pantry-style cabinets. Take out most of the wall between the kitchen and the family room. Gonna be messy around here for a while (9 weeks!) and Dena and I will be living in the basement that whole time. Should be “fun”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually had a few questions about the contract after we read it over and sent off an email asking for clarification on a few issues. Mostly minor, we’ll see what they say. I’m not too worried. Next step is to get the revised contract signed, give them a bunch of money to start and off we go!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kitchen Remodel Part I</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided to remodel our kitchen. Mind you, our kitchen looks fine the way it is…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1115.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1113.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kitchen 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but there are some problems. Mostly they stem from the fact that all the cabinet doors are falling off. You see, the previous owners seem to have had all the doors removed, stripped and restained to the color you see here. While that worked fine, one problem we’re finding is that the side walls of the cabinets are that cheap particle board and when you remove screws from it and then try to re-screw the hinges back into the same place, they just don’t stay. So we end up with a number of them looking like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hinge falling off&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse in one place, they wanted a big cabinet, so they just cut out the center partition that holds things up and we now have this happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cabinet sag&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we want a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having watched plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hgtv.com&quot;&gt;HGTV&lt;/a&gt; over the years, we knew we wanted a design-build company to come in and help us decide on how it should look and then actually do the work and subcontracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first found a local company who seemed interested, but after getting some preliminary renderings from them they went dark. No responses to our “We like this. We want to hire you. Please contact us.” emails so we gave up on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.propertyrevival.net&quot;&gt;Property Revival&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve been pretty good so far. We started with them almost a year ago. We’ve spent that time going over every little detail about what we want. Most of that time is Dena and I changing our minds on countertops, cabinets, faucets, sinks, etc. But we’re finally done picking things out and should be ready to start soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how the kitchen is laid out now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/img/IMG_1169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original kitchen layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to remove the peninsula and replace it with a big island. We’re also going to remove the wall between the kitchen and the family room to go with a more open concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon we should be signing the contract and having our final walk though and then getting on the calendar. I plan to keep blogging our progress as we go. So stay tuned. More to come (and soon I hope).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Back to Boating</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back to boating! Got off my butt recently and got started on it again. From the last blog post from, gosh, 2013 I was working on the nibbing strake on the foredeck. Wow, made a bit of progress since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, I got the aft deck completely planked. 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1067.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Completed aft deckplanking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I stained the whole deck
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1070.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Deck stained&quot; /&gt;
Why stain the deck now you ask? Well, the next step is to add the stanchions back on, finish planking above the waterway and paint all that white. By staining the deck now, I think it’ll make it easier to mask the deck and paint all the rest white. At least, I’ll find out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I had to re-attach all the stanchions I cut off before (see earlier post about creative destruction). So I built these guides I stuck to the outside so I could use them to make sure the stanchions all lined up properly. 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1073.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stanchion guides&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I think that worked: 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1160.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stanchions complete&quot; /&gt;
Also note my beautifully stained deck is now completely covered in blue painter’s tape. This is because once all the stanchions are on and the final two rows of planking are installed and the new rail put in place, I’ll have to paint all this white. And I’m gonna use spray paint for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, I’m cutting notches (I’m sorry, scuppers), in my planks. 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1167.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scuppers&quot; /&gt;
You see, the next row of planking has to go even with the waterway and there are supposed to be little tiny notches, I mean scuppers, cut into those planks on either side of nearly every stanchion. So, I laid out the planks, marked where all the stanchions are, measured and marked where all the fake stanchions will go between all those currently in place and now I’m cutting notches. I’m actually using a small file to file out those notches. Each one you see there is about 1/32” wide. Kinda small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. Last of the updates for now. I hope to keep on working and keep on blogging about this. Feels good to be back into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See ya!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JIm&lt;/p&gt;
