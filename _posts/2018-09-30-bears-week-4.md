## Can they move to 3-1?

The Bears started a somewhat surprising 2-1 this season. Most of that  on the back of the defense which is unsurprising given the addition of Khalil Mack. This week they face another surprisingly good team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Can the Bears beat them and move to 3-1 on the season? I won't be surprised if they don't. 

So far this season, the Bucs back-up quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick has been surprisingly good. Over 400 yards passing per game and 11 touchdowns. That's impressive. From what I've read though, he hasn't  been pressured and he doesn't do well under pressure. This favors the Bears who have one of the best, if not *the* best, front 7 in the NFL. I expect them to get to Fitzpatrick and force him to make a number of mistakes. That's the good news. 

On the other side, Tampa Bay has a pretty good run defense which will force the Bears to rely on Trubisky to make plays downfield. From what we've seen so far, that probably won't happen. Eventually Trubisky is going to get comfortable in the pocket and make those plays, I'm just not sure that will happen this week. 

In the end, I expect the Bears offense will be effectively stymied and the defense will be mostly effective but still have a couple of blown plays resulting in scores. 

**Prediction:** Bears 10, Buccaneers 17

Go Bears!
