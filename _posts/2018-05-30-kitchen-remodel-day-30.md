## Drywalling

Today the dry wall people came and patched things up.

You can see they got the left-over wall all covered up. Patched up the holes in the walls and fixed up the ceiling.

And over here is the other side of the opening to the family room. Guess we'll have a little angle-thing in the corner there. 

I cheated a bit. I know I said I'd blog every day someone was here doing something. Well, yesterday the electrician was back doing a couple more things. They put in one too many can-lights in the ceiling so he had to come back and remove the wiring for one of them. That was about it. Didn't seem worth blogging about so I didn't. Mea culpa. 

See ya' next time!
