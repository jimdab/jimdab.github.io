Finished up putting handles on all things and re-did the island. I guess they think the countertops will be heavy.

Pretty slow day. I think now we won't see much change for a while. The countertop guys are supposed to be in tomorrow to make templates so they can go make the countertops and then come put them on. I think there will be more trim work done in the meanwhile. I'll keep you all updated as things go by.
