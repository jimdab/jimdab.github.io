Well, today we got some good news and some bad news. 

**The good news:** Got a call from the lead guy, Jerry, telling me things are going great. They got the inspection from the city today and all is well. They are happy with all the structural work and things can move ahead. Even better, the workers are ahead of schedule even, _way_ ahead of schedule. Things are great. 

**The bad news:** According to the schedule, the next step is to have the electrician and plumber come in and do the work they need to do. But, since we're _way_ ahead of schedule, they aren't ready to be here until week after next. So...a bit of a "lull" in the project. If they can get the folks to come out sooner, great, but usually they're pretty booked up so...be patient. 

_sigh_

Take care all.
