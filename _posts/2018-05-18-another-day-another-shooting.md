Another day, another senseless school shooting, and another round of politicians offering their "thoughts and prayers" while not actually doing anything about the epidemic of gun violence in this country. I've reached the point where all I can conclude from this is politicians *want* these shootings to continue. 

Why they want this, I don't know. I know if they actually wanted to reduce the number of people murdered every year by gun violence, they would take action by passing sensible laws to restrict or otherwise control the flood of arms and ammunition into our society. But they don't. Hence I can only conclude they don't want to. They want this violence to continue. 

I know, they talk about second amendment rights and how they can't do anything, but that's bullshit plain and simple. We don't let people in this country buy fully automatic weapons and that's constitutional. Why not restrict the ownership of other types of weapons as well? 

Because they don't want to. 

We already have laws that prevent certain people from owning guns and those laws are perfectly constitutional. Why not pass more laws expanding who can't own a gun? 

Because they don't want to. 

They'll say laws like that don't actually reduce gun violence but that's a lie. Reduce the availability of guns and you'll reduce gun violence. It's that simple. 

My own congressman, Paul Ryan, is the goddamn Speaker of the House! He sets the legislative agenda for the entire House of Representatives. *He* decides which bills come to the floor and which do not. Furthermore, he announced he's retiring at the end of this term so he has nothing to fear from constituents or doners and yet...he'll do nothing. All I can conclude is that he, like all the other politicians in congress, for some sick reason, *wants* this senseless slaughter of children to continue. I don't understand it. 

I don't care what party any of these people belong to, they're all at fault because they all clearly want this to continue. If they didn't, they'd do something about it. 

It *is* that simple.
