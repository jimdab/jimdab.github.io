And the walls come tumbling down---well, sort of.

Continue to make slow but steady progress I guess. That whole wall, for the most part, is coming down and will then be open to the family room. Looks like they'll need to move some plumbing I'm thinking. 

Then in the foyer they got that top layer of tile off.

Maybe we should just leave it? Kinda trendy and plaid-looking with the old tile and the left-over grout. OK, maybe not. 

That's it for today.
