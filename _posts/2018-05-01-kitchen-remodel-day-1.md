Here it is! Day 1! The start of our kitchen remodel. I hope to post every day about how the changes went so *everyone* can share with me the joys of a full kitchen remodel. 

First a reminder. 

Before:

And after:

And I must say, this is going to be interesting: 

![Foyer]({{ site.url }}/img/IMG_1266.jpg)

They mentioned there being concrete below the tile in the foyer but they didn't quite notice the layer of tile *below* the current tile, and then concrete below that. No word yet on if this'll cost us extra. They were already anticipating having to jack-hammer all the concrete out---maybe that extra layer of tile won't matter. 

That's it for day 1. Stay tuned!
