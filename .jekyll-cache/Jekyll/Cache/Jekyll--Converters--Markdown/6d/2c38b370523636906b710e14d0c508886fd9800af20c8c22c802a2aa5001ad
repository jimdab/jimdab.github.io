I"³<p>What?!? Day 21! Yeah, I reconsidered my day numbering convention. At first, I was going to go by work-days. They started on Tuesday the first, worked through Friday the 4th, thatâ€™s 4 days, but then I counted the following Monday as day 5, not day 7. But now with this lull I realized, who cares about work-days, I want to keep count of how many days Iâ€™m without a functioning kitchen! So, <em>this is</em> Day 21. So there.</p>
