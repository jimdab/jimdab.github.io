<p>And there was light.</p>

<p>There it is. I think weâ€™re entering the final stretch. Electrician was here and he put in all the outlets, switches and ceiling lights. Makes a real difference. Looking almost done.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a closer-up shot of the actual lights over the island. Dena has a really good eye for that sort of thing. She picks well.</p>

<p>And we got flames too! Check this out. Six full burners of bright blue flames. Not sure Iâ€™ll ever cook six things at once, but you never know. Thanksgivings get mighty crowded around here sometimes.</p>

<p>Back Monday to paint, and tile, and fix the one pantry cabinet, and finish up some plumbing and finish up some electrical. Yeah, right. Thatâ€™s the plan at least. Seems a bit unrealistic to me given how pokey this whole thing has been. But, weâ€™ll see.</p>

<p>Until then, we may actually cook something on our new range this weekend. Iâ€™ll let you know if we do.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>
