I"Ø	<p>Well, Iâ€™ve been working on my boat some, just not posting here very much. Thought Iâ€™d give you all a before &amp; after update.</p>

<p>When I last left you, I had just completed some creative destruction.</p>

<p>Which resulted in the boat looking something like this.</p>

<p>The next step was to smooth things out across the top of the bulkheads. Recall that the point of all this was to give me a smooth, level surface on which to put new stanchions and the last of the planking. So, how to sand smooth that curved surface of the deck? I came up with this idea.</p>

<p>Since the bulkheads were provided to me laser-cut, I still had the leftover frame from around the bulkheads (See! Itâ€™s important <strong>not</strong> to throw anything away!)

<p>I figured that I could use those already pre-curved pieces of wood to make a sanding block. So I cut them all out. Stacked and glued them together.

<p>And then glued a piece of sandpaper to the curved surface and voilÃ ! A perfectly curved sanding block!

<p>The next step was to start re-attaching the waterway. These are the deck planks that run between (cough, cough) the stanchions and for a couple of rows inboard. These are typically thicker than the regular deck planking. So, this is what I ended up with.

<p>Another feature I implemented when installing the waterway was to color the edges of the wood with pencil. Why would I do this you ask? Well, on a normal boat, there would be caulk between the deck planks that is normally a darker color than the decking. I read online that an easy way of achieving this look is to color one edge of each plank with a pencil. Then, when sanded and finished, thin dark lines will show up between the edges of the decking and look like caulk!

<p>Thatâ€™s it for this update. Next up, trenailing! (Iâ€™ve said that before!)</p>
