<p>I recently said to my wife, I wanted to watch a boring Bears game. By that I meant I wanted to see the Bears score quickly, take charge of the game and cruise to an easy victory with the end never in any doubt.</p>

<p>Today, I got that game.</p>

<p>I could not have been more wrong in my prediction earlier today when I said I doubted Trubisky would make the plays downfield he would need to make to win this game. He made those plays all game long. This is the kind of offensive performance most fans have been hoping the Bears  would have all season and today they delivered.</p>

<p>Off to a bye-week and then they go to Miami. Iâ€™m excited to see what changes the Bears make and how they perform after the bye.</p>

<p>Bear down!</p>
