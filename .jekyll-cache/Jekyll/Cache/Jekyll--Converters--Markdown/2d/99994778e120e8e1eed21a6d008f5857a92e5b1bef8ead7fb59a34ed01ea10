I"ê<p>Yep, it‚Äôs pronounced tree-nailing because that is what I am doing. The planks on a ship are usually held in place with wooden pegs driven into the ends of each plank and into each bulkhead the plank spans. So, to simulate that on the Bluenose, I have to get a bunch of little sticks, drill holes in all the planks at each bulkhead and glue them in place. How small you say? How does .028‚Ä≥ diameter grab ya?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm doing this in columns at each bulkhead. While planking, I was drawing a pencil line along each plank so that I knew where each bulkhead was. I kind of stopped doing that toward the end of the planking.</p>

<p>First step is to drill holes with a .028‚Ä≥ drill-bit stuck in my dremel tool. Handy little thing.</p>

<p>I used painter‚Äôs tape to mark off a straight line along the bulkhead so that I could keep all my trenails lined up nicely.</p>

<p>Then drill.</p>

<p>Ta-da!</p>

<p>Once that‚Äôs done, I take one of my small sticks and dip it in some Elmer‚Äôs wood glue.</p>

<p>Then stick it in a hole I drilled.</p>

<p>Snip it off with my handy Xuron clippers.</p>

<p>And repeat until an entire bulkhead is done.</p>

<p>Then I sand it smooth and move on to the next bulkhead. The process actually goes pretty easily. I‚Äôve got one side completed entirely by now and am about half-way done with the other side. The most difficult part of the whole process was making the little sticks out of bigger sticks. I think that will be the topic of my next post.</p>
