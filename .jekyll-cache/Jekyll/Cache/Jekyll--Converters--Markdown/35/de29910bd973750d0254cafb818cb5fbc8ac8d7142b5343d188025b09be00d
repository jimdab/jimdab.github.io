I"®<p>Another day, another senseless school shooting, and another round of politicians offering their â€œthoughts and prayersâ€ while not actually doing anything about the epidemic of gun violence in this country. Iâ€™ve reached the point where all I can conclude from this is politicians <em>want</em> these shootings to continue.</p>

<p>Why they want this, I donâ€™t know. I know if they actually wanted to reduce the number of people murdered every year by gun violence, they would take action by passing sensible laws to restrict or otherwise control the flood of arms and ammunition into our society. But they donâ€™t. Hence I can only conclude they donâ€™t want to. They want this violence to continue.</p>

<p>I know, they talk about second amendment rights and how they canâ€™t do anything, but thatâ€™s bullshit plain and simple. We donâ€™t let people in this country buy fully automatic weapons and thatâ€™s constitutional. Why not restrict the ownership of other types of weapons as well?</p>

<p>Because they donâ€™t want to.</p>

<p>We already have laws that prevent certain people from owning guns and those laws are perfectly constitutional. Why not pass more laws expanding who canâ€™t own a gun?</p>

<p>Because they donâ€™t want to.</p>

<p>Theyâ€™ll say laws like that donâ€™t actually reduce gun violence but thatâ€™s a lie. Reduce the availability of guns and youâ€™ll reduce gun violence. Itâ€™s that simple.</p>

<p>My own congressman, Paul Ryan, is the goddamn Speaker of the House! He sets the legislative agenda for the entire House of Representatives. <em>He</em> decides which bills come to the floor and which do not. Furthermore, he announced heâ€™s retiring at the end of this term so he has nothing to fear from constituents or doners and yetâ€¦heâ€™ll do nothing. All I can conclude is that he, like all the other politicians in congress, for some sick reason, <em>wants</em> this senseless slaughter of children to continue. I donâ€™t understand it.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t care what party any of these people belong to, theyâ€™re all at fault because they all clearly want this to continue. If they didnâ€™t, theyâ€™d do something about it.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> that simple.</p>
