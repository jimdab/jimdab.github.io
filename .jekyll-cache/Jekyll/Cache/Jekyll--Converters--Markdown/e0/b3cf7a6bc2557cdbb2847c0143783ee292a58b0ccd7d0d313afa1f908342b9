<p>Today the dry wall people came and patched things up.</p>

<p>You can see they got the left-over wall all covered up. Patched up the holes in the walls and fixed up the ceiling.</p>

<p>And over here is the other side of the opening to the family room. Guess weâ€™ll have a little angle-thing in the corner there.</p>

<p>I cheated a bit. I know I said Iâ€™d blog every day someone was here doing something. Well, yesterday the electrician was back doing a couple more things. They put in one too many can-lights in the ceiling so he had to come back and remove the wiring for one of them. That was about it. Didnâ€™t seem worth blogging about so I didnâ€™t. Mea culpa.</p>

<p>See yaâ€™ next time!</p>
