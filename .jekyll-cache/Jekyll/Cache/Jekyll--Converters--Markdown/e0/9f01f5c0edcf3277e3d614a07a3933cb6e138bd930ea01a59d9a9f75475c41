I"ð<p>Well, that went almost as I expected, except for the offensive line looking awful. I mean, câ€™mon, the Panthers rush <em>three</em> and <strong>still</strong> get pressure on the QB? But I digress. The Bears did put up 20+ points and Iâ€™m not sure what I was thinking when I thought theyâ€™d hold the Panthers to under 10. Thatâ€™s not very realistic in todayâ€™s NFL. However, they did take an early lead and never looked back all while holding their opponent to under 20 points again.</p>
