I"Ó<p>Well that was embarrassing. I wanted to post something here yesterday, fired up my computer, looked in my Sites directory, saw all my files and realized I had no idea which tool I used to build this site. Iâ€™ve obsessed for years trying to find the â€œrightâ€ tool to use and have tried many, many tools. Eventually I apparently picked one but now had no idea which one. Looked around my site and my last post was from over a year ago. <em>sigh</em> This morning I realized that I might have blogged about it. So I looked at a past post and found my <a href="/blog/2014/08/24/blog-reboot.html">blog reboot post</a> wherein I mentioned that I used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Yay! Of course, for some reason Jekyll wasnâ€™t installed on this machine so I had to reinstall it, but that was easy and now Iâ€™m back up and running so when inspiration strikes, I can post. (Iâ€™ve also updated the footer on this site to remind me what tool I use to do this.)</p>
