I"<p>Just a minor update here. I’ve been working steadily on the boat actually, but there just isn’t too much to show you.</p>

<p><span class="more"></span></p>

<p>After completing all the trenailing I had to sand the hull all smooth.</p>

<p>After some sanding, I then took some wood filler and filled in all the cracks. I wasn’t looking to create a perfectly smooth hull with the filler because then that would just end up hiding all the trenails and other work I did. And it wouldn’t look like a wooden boat, it would look like fiberglass.</p>

<p>Finally I ended up with this.</p>

<p>Then cam time to prime.</p>

<p>First, I wanted to mask off the deck. That part is going to be varnished to keep the natural wood look.</p>

<p>Then, several coats of white primer with sanding and cleaning in between and it is all ready for its real paint job.</p>

<p>That will come in a bit once I am done planking the deck, re-adding the bulkhead stanchions and then finishing the planking above the waist.</p>

<p>Next time, planking the fore deck, stay tuned…</p>
