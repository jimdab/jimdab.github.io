I"¯<p>We killed our cat yesterday. Well, more accurately, we had him killed yesterday. Such a blunt way of putting it, yet itâ€™s accurate. In polite society we say we â€œhad him put downâ€ which sounds so much nicer  yet amounts to the same thing. His name was Scaliwag (and it bugs me that all my spell-checkers insist his name should be spelled â€˜Scalawagâ€™ instead) and heâ€™d been a part of our family for about 15 years.</p>
