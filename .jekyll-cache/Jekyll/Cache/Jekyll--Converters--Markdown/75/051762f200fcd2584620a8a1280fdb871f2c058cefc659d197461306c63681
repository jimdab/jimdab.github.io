<p>Weâ€™re giving up. Coming up on day 100 of the <em>Great Kitchen Remodel</em> and they <strong>still</strong> arenâ€™t done. Though I think Iâ€™m done blogging about it until they are.</p>

<p>It hasnâ€™t been totally silent. Last week Monday they installed the pop-up outlet. Thatâ€™s pretty cool. Of course, that was the only thing that happened last week. Today they came in a cleaned up a few odds and ends, but that was it. Who knows what else will be done or when it will be done. They donâ€™t really talk to us much any more other than tell us they have to get the plumber back in, they have to get the tile guy back in, they have to get the electrician back inâ€¦sigh.</p>

<p>At this point, Iâ€™m just hoping theyâ€™re done by Thanksgiving. But until then, Iâ€™m done writing about this fiasco. Next post will be when itâ€™s all done and I hope to have some before and after pics to sum it all up.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
