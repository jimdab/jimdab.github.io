I"‡<p>I just donâ€™t have a lot to say this time and I missed last weekâ€™s prediction, so first letâ€™s go back a week. I thought the game would be a toss-up leaning toward a Bears loss. I wasnâ€™t convinced the offense would put enough points on the board and Brady would pick apart the middle of the Bears field. Didnâ€™t happen. Bears hung in there and pulled out a win. Good for them.</p>
