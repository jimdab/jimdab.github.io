I"~<p>I’m three-quarters of the way done with planking the boat!</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I’ve been able to work much on it. Lacrosse season started and I was working furiously to get the Lacrosse Scorebook app up and running that I just didn’t have any time to work on the boat. But now, Lacrosse season is over and the app is out being beta-tested for the summer and so now I have some time in the evenings to get back to planking. I’ve now finished the third belt on the starboard side. Next step is to finish up each side down to the keel. I’ll keep you posted as it goes. Hopefully sooner than the last update! In the meanwhile, enjoy the pics below.</p>
