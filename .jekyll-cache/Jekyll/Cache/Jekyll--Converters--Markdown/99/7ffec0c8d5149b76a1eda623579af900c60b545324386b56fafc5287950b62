I"°<p>Eh. Had our â€œfinal walk-throughâ€ with the builders. The lead guy came here with the lead builder-guy who will be doing most of the work. They pretty much agreed that, yep, work needed to be done. About the only new thing that came out of this meeting was our start date: May 1.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em></p>

<p>So hopefully weâ€™ll have our new kitchen in place by July 1.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it. See ya next time!</p>
