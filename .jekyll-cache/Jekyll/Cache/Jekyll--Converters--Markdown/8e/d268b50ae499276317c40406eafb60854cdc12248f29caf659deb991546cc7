I"ª<p>Here it is! Day 1! The start of our kitchen remodel. I hope to post every day about how the changes went so <em>everyone</em> can share with me the joys of a full kitchen remodel.</p>

<p>First a reminder.</p>

<p>Before:

<p>And after:

<p>And I must say, this is going to be interesting:</p>

<p><img src="http://jimdab.com/img/IMG_1266.jpg" alt="Foyer" /></p>

<p>They mentioned there being concrete below the tile in the foyer but they didnâ€™t quite notice the layer of tile <em>below</em> the current tile, and then concrete below that. No word yet on if thisâ€™ll cost us extra. They were already anticipating having to jack-hammer all the concrete outâ€”maybe that extra layer of tile wonâ€™t matter.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it for day 1. Stay tuned!</p>
