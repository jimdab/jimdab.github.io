<p>Back to being clever (<em>or so I think</em>). Looks like cabinet folks spent the day putting some handles on our cabinets. We really like them.</p>

<p>And here we have our floating shelves. Those too turned out super nice.</p>

<p>And finally, they have the outline of the table built. Love the legs we picked out.</p>

<p>Now weâ€™re gonna have our first, change our mind and itâ€™s gonna cost us, moment. We think the island is too short. That there is 9 feet long (or thereabouts). Our intention is for 4 people to sit in this area, one on each side and 2 on the end. That will work with whatâ€™s there, but if people are on the sides and the end, we think knees will be bumping. Probably not too bad, but we donâ€™t want to feel cramped. We have the room, so weâ€™re gonna ask them to re-do that portion and lengthen it out to 10 feet. This will give people on the sides plenty of room. Now I get to compose the email to the contractor.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it. That was a nice anniversary present to us. Now we get to go out to dinner. Eating out at <a href="https://www.clarabo.com">Clara Bo</a> in Beloit, WI.</p>
