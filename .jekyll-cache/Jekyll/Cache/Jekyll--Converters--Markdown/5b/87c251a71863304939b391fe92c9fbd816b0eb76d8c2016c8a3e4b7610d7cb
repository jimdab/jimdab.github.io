I"*<p><a href="http://www.nfl.com/draft/2017/profiles/mitchell-trubisky?id=2558008">Thursday night</a> I said to my wife I thought the Bears were suddenly 5+ years away from being competitive. Another couple years of Pace &amp; Co., theyâ€™re fired and the Bears are back to looking for a new GM, head coach and several more years of rebuilding. Trading away 3 picks to move up one spot for a quarterback that would likely have been there for them at #3 made no sense to me. After a few days to mull it over and read opinions, my feelings have changed.</p>
