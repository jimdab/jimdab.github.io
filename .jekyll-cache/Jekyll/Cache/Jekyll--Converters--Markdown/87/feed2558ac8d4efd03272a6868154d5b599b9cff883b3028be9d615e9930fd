I"ø	<p>As promised, here is a little tale of how I made all the little sticks I needed for the trenailing featured in the last post.</p>

<p>After some research, I learned that the best way to do this is by using a draw plate and bamboo skewers. For those who don‚Äôt know, a draw plate is typically used to create wire. You stick a piece of wire into a hole slightly smaller than the wire currently is and pull it through. This will stretch it out and make it narrower. Repeat this process until you have a wire the diameter you want. This same process can apply to whittling bamboo skewers down to a needed size.</p>

<p>So I did. Start with a bamboo skewer and split it into several smaller skewers.</p>

<p>And now onto the draw plate.</p>

<p>I actually started with a different draw plate that wasn‚Äôt too well made. The holes in it weren‚Äôt very consistent and it didn‚Äôt work too well. So, I bought the one pictured above. Great draw plate. The numbers you see are thousandth‚Äôs of an inch.</p>

<p>Since we aren‚Äôt stretching wire but instead shaving bamboo, you use the draw plate ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù; by putting it through the back end.</p>

<p>When it sticks out the other side, I grab it with a pair of pliers and pull.</p>

<p>This generates lots of little wood shavings.</p>

<p>Basically repeat the process moving from one hole down to the next one. Sometimes it would take several pulls through to get it fully narrowed down before I could move to the next one. Since the drill bit I was using was .028‚Ä≥; I kept this up until I got down to the 26 hole.</p>

<p>Here is a shot of about what it looks like in a few stages.</p>

<p>I actually completed all the trenailing and have been working on filling, sanding and smoothing the hull. It looks good. I‚Äôll post about that next.</p>
