I"®<p>What?!? Day 21! Yeah, I reconsidered my day numbering convention. At first, I was going to go by work-days. They started on Tuesday the first, worked through Friday the 4th, thatâ€™s 4 days, but then I counted the following Monday as day 5, not day 7. But now with this lull I realized, who cares about work-days, I want to keep count of how many days Iâ€™m without a functioning kitchen! So, <em>this is</em> Day 21. So there.</p>

<p>Finally got back to work today. Plumber came to remove some old plumbing and put in some new.</p>

<p>See those nice new pipes sticking up out of the floor? Thatâ€™s our water for our sink and a drain. How nice.</p>

<p>See those tape lines on the floor? Dena and I got impatient and taped out where the island was going to go so we could get a better feel for what this will look like when itâ€™s done. We like it so far.</p>

<p>They also took out that last little bit of wall. Cabinets will be all along that wall.</p>

<p>I thought about titling this post, â€œAnother day, another change-orderâ€. Any time something new comes up that wasnâ€™t in the original estimate, they file what they call a change-order. Itâ€™s essentially a legal addendum to our contract specifying what additional thing weâ€™re going to have to pay for. Some of these have been expectedâ€”money for the permits, credit for their <em>not</em> having to jack-hammer out the concrete in the foyer. That sort of things. Others not so expected, but I kinda feel like they should have been.</p>

<p>Take today for instance. Weâ€™re going to have another change order because, by code, when they put in new plumbing they also have to put in something called â€œnailing platesâ€. Now, if this is something required by code and they knew they were putting in new plumbing, donâ€™t you think they would have known they also had to put in nailing plates and factored that into the estimate? <em>I</em> think so. <em>smh</em></p>

<p>Anyway, it was good to once again see some progress. Iâ€™ll keep on blogging as long as they keep on working.</p>
