<p>Iâ€™ve been slacking a little bit lately. Theyâ€™ve been here doing things in bits and pieces. They got the backsplash for the range in place. They cleaned. They got the microwave installed and did some additional electrical stuff (<em>but of course, didnâ€™t install the popup outlet because weâ€™re still lacking a hole</em>). And I havenâ€™t been blogging any of that.</p>

<p><strong>Because we just want them done!!!</strong></p>

<p>This is just dragging on way too long and weâ€™re both getting a bit worn out by the whole process. We just want them done and out of our house. The last two days theyâ€™ve made some progress by finishing tiling some additional backsplash. This was an extra.</p>

<p>We went from this.</p>

<p>To this.</p>

<p>After they got the backsplash on the other wall, Dena was looking around and decided she wanted it continued there in that little opening. So we did it. Weâ€™re pretty happy. We think it helps tie the whole room together a bit more.</p>

<p>Still a few more odds and ends and we still might not have the whole lien thing worked out yet. Iâ€™ll check on the status of that tomorrow. I think itâ€™s taken care of but one more call to be sure.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it,</p>
